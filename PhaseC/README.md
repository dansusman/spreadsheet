# CS4530 Group 305 Spreadsheet Application

This repository holds the source code for our Phase C submission for the final project of CS4530 Software Engineering.

Please see the report for details/specifications about the application's architecture, implementation, and our design practices.

## Installation
To install and run our Spreadsheet application, you will first need to ensure your version of Node.JS is up-to-date. We recommend 
version 16.13 or later. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Clone the repository or download the zip file of the final-submission 
release on GitHub. See [this resource](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) for more information about releases. Once the download succeeds, open a terminal and change 
directory into the downloaded source code. Change directory again into the PhaseC subdirectory. Once here, run `npm i` or `yarn` to install 
all necessary dependencies. You can install yarn by following [this guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and npm following [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Once your yarn or npm installation has 
completed successfully, simply run `yarn start` or `npm start` and the spreadsheet application will start up. Open your web browser and 
navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see our application running. Follow the User Guide in section 2 of the report for detailed application usage.
